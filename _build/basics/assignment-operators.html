<h1 id="Compound-Assignment-Operators">Compound Assignment Operators<a class="anchor-link" href="#Compound-Assignment-Operators"> </a></h1><p>We've already discussed the <code>=</code> operator which sets the value of a variable. There are a few more assignment operators which are mostly used for convenience. These are the compound operators : <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>.</p>
<p>These operators apply their respective operation between the variable being assigned to and the value on the right and assign that value to the variable. In other words:</p>

<pre><code>var += 2</code></pre>
<p>can be read as</p>

<pre><code>var = var + 2</code></pre>
<p>and</p>

<pre><code>var /= 2</code></pre>
<p>can be read as</p>

<pre><code>var = var / 2</code></pre>
<p>etc..</p>
