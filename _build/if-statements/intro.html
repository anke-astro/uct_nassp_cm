In order to make complex programs, we need to make more than a list of statements to be executed sequentially. Control flow gives us tools to execute blocks of code conditionally (with if statements) and repeatedly (with loops).</p>
<p>In this chapter we shall cover if statements, but first we need to discuss Boolean data types and the logical operators which act on them.</p>
