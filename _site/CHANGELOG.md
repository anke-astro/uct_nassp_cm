## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Renamed directories `if_statements` to `if-statements` and `data_structures` to `data-structures` as the underscore seemed to be causing some issues in the _site (the directories were repeated but with `-` and excluding images). Hopefully this will fix the GitHubPages website.
