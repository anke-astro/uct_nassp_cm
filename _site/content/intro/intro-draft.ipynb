    "At the lowest level the language of computers is called machine code. This language is used to communicate with the computers CPU through binary or hexadecimal instructions (which is not easy for humans to read).\n",
    "This language is dependent on the computer hardware being used and is not easy to understand as humans. A step up from this is <!--- the programming language assembly (built in binary), \n",

    "Python is a high level language and thus needs to eventually be translated into machine code. Many high level programming languages' source code (the instructions written in the programming language) is compiled to machine code once, and then can be executed in this form. These are called static programming languages (C is an example). Dynamic programming languages are languages where operations that would normally take place at compile-time (when the code is compiled) can instead be done at run-time (when the program is executed) {% cite mozilla_dynamic %}. Python is a dynamic programming language.\n",

    "A dynamic programming language is one that does not require data types to be defined when you are writing a script. Generally these languages achieve this by not compiling the scripts into machine code before you can run it. Instead chunks of code are compiled as the script is running. This flexibility comes at a cost, however, as the process of compiling can be quite slow. This cost can be reduced somewhat by pre-compiling portions of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python modules you will come across later, some of the methods they provide run pre-compiled code in a different programming language (generally C from which Python itself is built) . This means that they are more efficient than a similar solution written purely in Python.\n",
