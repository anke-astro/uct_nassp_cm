    "# Variable Names\n",
    "So far we have been using single letters (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, ...) as variable names, but this approach can be confusing for long segments of codes. Variable names should be as clear and descriptive as possible (describing what they are used for), while still being short enough to type out efficiently.\n",

    "To this end we should delve into some of the restrictions on the character sequences that make up variable names:\n",
    "* The characters must all be letters, digits, or underscores (\\_) , and must start with a letter. In particular, punctuation and blanks are not allowed.\n",
    "* There are some words that are reserved for special use in Python. You may not use these words as your own identifiers. This is the full list:"
